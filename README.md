# cpp - The Xicstpimbach scripts are ROOT macros I used in my MPhys project. 

The three root macros are very similar up until the subsection 'Plot Xicstpimbach_M' written in a comment. The different macros correspond to the different fitting methods I used to show the significance of the baryon resonance; signal yield (_yield), unbinned (_unbinned) and a binned fraction based method (_fit).
